This is a bunch of junk that allows me to have my vim set up the way I like
it, using Inconsolata, with go plugins, etc.

The _vimrc and .vimrc files both alias to the _vimrc, since Windows and OSX
are kind of dumb with dotfiles sometimes.

The file the _vimrc is reasonably well-documented, but I don't pretend to
understand (or have written) most of it. The vimrc parts are taken from
the weird part of the internet, and the go parts are taken from the go
sources. I have a separate copy because the appengine sdk goroot doesn't
include `misc/vim`.

I pieced it together, mostly from sugar packets.


You have to install vundle and have Vim 7.3 for a lot of the cool
stuff to work properly.
