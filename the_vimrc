" Remapping for Colemak
" 

" This remaps the movemet keys j and k (In Colemak, J (= Qwerty Y) is placed
" above K (= Qwerty N), which I find confusing in Vim since j moves down and k
" up. I think the remappings below result in a more logical and easier to
" reach layout, keeping in mind that space and backspace (= Qwerty Caps-Lock)
" can be used instead of Colemak J (= Qwerty Y). I use the join-lines command
" much more than the help command, and have therefore swapped J and K since I
" find Colemak K (Qwerty N) much easier to reach than Colemak J (Qwerty Y).
